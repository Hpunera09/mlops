It's perfect. Go for it. Yonex will never disappoint you. Pros - 1. The feather might look little cheap at first glance but it ain't like that. The quality it best.2. The bottom cork is so amazing. We play in an open court and it perfectly glides around. Balanced base. 3. The durability seems to go fine. No issues on that. We (intermediate players) have been using one shuttle since 2 days now. Cons - 1. Slightly on a higher range. 2. If you use 30lbs + BG 65 or 98 racquet then it's p... MORE,5,1

"Excellent synthetic shuttles from Yonex. I have used 350s, 500s as well as 2000s. I prefer these yellow ones for the visibility. In general the 350s are quite durable and long lasting (one shuttle can easily last half a dozen to a dozen intense games before the flight becomes unacceptable), and i found them to travel shorter distances than the 2000s and therefore prefer them.

Good one for us. We play outdoor everyday. Constant play for 2 hours. The shuttle lasted for three weeks. We don't play professional but we do play hard. And few of us are not really good so we hit the shuttle with the rod as well. But still the shuttle is good. The one point I removed is for the plastic which starts to get ruptured and the price should be within middle class range. It is a little higher. MORE,4,1

The box had got crushed in the cardboard box. Please don't pack in thin cardboard boxes. Instead pack it in plastic covers along with the bubble sheet wrapped around the box. This way the shuttles won't get damaged. Slightly out of shape......the shuttlles will not perform at all... So next time I order shuttles I expect a proper delivery without damage or else I will return. MORE,1,0

There can be some variation though from one box to another in the speed.The shuttle lasts a long time and that can be a problem because the flight pattern changes after say 12-15 games.
