It's perfect. Go for it. Yonex will never disappoint you. Pros - 1. The feather might look little cheap at first glance but it ain't like that. The quality it best.2. The bottom cork is so amazing. We play in an open court and it perfectly glides around. Balanced base. 3. The durability seems to go fine. No issues on that. We (intermediate players) have been using one shuttle since 2 days now. Cons - 1. Slightly on a higher range. 2. If you use 30lbs + BG 65 or 98 racquet then it's p... MORE,5,1

"Excellent synthetic shuttles from Yonex. I have used 350s, 500s as well as 2000s. I prefer these yellow ones for the visibility.

Good one for us. We play outdoor everyday. Constant play for 2 hours. The shuttle lasted for three weeks. We don't play professional but we do play hard. And few of us are not really good so we hit the shuttle with the rod as well. But still the shuttle is good. The one point I removed is for the plastic which starts to get ruptured and the price should be within middle class range. It is a little higher. MORE,4,1

We are playing with mavis 350 from last 5 years. I am buying mavis 350 from flipkart since last 3 years. Off late the quality of shuttles have degraded.

This makes me doubt about the quality of shuttles. MORE,3,0
